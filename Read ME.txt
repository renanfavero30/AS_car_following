## 📂 Dataset Overview

The file **`dataset_models`** contains the cleaned dataset used for training and testing.  
Below are the main variables included:

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `Time_[s]` | Time of the trajectory (s) |
| `Leader_pos_[ft]` | Position of the leader vehicle (ft) |
| `Leader_sp_[ft]` | Speed of the leader vehicle (ft/s) |
| `delta_s` | Spacing between leader and follower (ft) |
| `delta_v` | Speed difference between leader and follower (ft/s) |
| `Follower_sp_[ft]` | Autonomous shuttle speed (ft/s) |
| `Follower_acc` | Real AS acceleration (ft/s²) |
| `Follower_pos_[ft]` | Real AS position (ft) |
| `Follower_sp_[ft]_t-1` | AS speed at previous time step (ft/s) |
| `Follower_pos_[ft]_t-1` | AS position at previous time step (ft) |
| `Follower_acc_t-1` | AS acceleration at previous time step (ft/s²) |
| `delta_t` | Time step interval (s) |
| `trajectory_id` | Unique trajectory identifier |
